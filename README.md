# Demo App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.3.

## Install json server
Use Json Server as fake backend. Data is from db.json
Opne command prompt and run `nNpm install -g json-server` in order to install json server on premises.


## Json server

Run `npm run json-run` for a json server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.


## Install Node Modules

Run `npm install` to install the node modules from package.json

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).


# Future improvements
More unit test coverage
Create End to End tests
Lint and improve the code further
Setup Wallaby.js for real time unit testing
Use Wallaby for unit test coverage


## Performance Optimization
Implement Lazy Loading: Break down the application into different modules and use lazy loading to improve initial load time.
Optimize Bundle Size: Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify and eliminate unnecessary imports and dependencies.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Implement SSR with Angular Universal to improve the initial page load time and SEO.
Enable Compression: Use GZIP or Brotli compression for serving your application to reduce the size of the payload.
Code Quality and Maintainability
Refactor for Clean Code: Regularly refactor code to adhere to clean code principles, improving readability and maintainability.
Implement Strict Typing: Ensure strict typing is enforced to catch errors at compile time.
Automate Code Linting: Integrate tools like ESLint to automate code linting and maintain coding standards.
Unit and E2E Testing: Increase the coverage of unit and end-to-end tests to ensure application reliability.
Update Angular and Dependencies: Regularly update Angular and its dependencies to the latest stable versions for improved features and security.

## Security Enhancements
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP): Add CSP headers to protect against XSS attacks.
Sanitize User Inputs: Ensure all user inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
Secure HTTP Headers: Use HTTP headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and X-XSS-Protection.
Audit Dependencies: Regularly audit third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## User Experience (UX) Improvements
Accessibility Improvements: Make the application accessible by following WCAG guidelines.
Implement Progressive Web App (PWA) Features: Add PWA features like offline capabilities and home screen installation.
Optimize Images and Assets: Ensure images and assets are optimized for fast loading without compromising quality.
Development Workflow Enhancements
Implement CI/CD Pipeline: Set up continuous integration and deployment for efficient and reliable delivery.
Dockerize the Application: Containerize the application with Docker for consistent development, testing, and deployment environments.
Improve Documentation: Maintain comprehensive documentation for the codebase and architectural decisions.

## Additional Features
Internationalization (i18n): Implement internationalization to support multiple languages.
Theme Customization: Add support for dynamic theme switching to enhance user customization options.
Analytics Integration: Integrate analytics to gather insights on user behavior and application performance.
Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback system to gather user input and continuously improve the application.
